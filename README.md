Hello! Im BeeseChurger (He/Him), also known as D3vi1i5hV0id and Brandon. Im a student at SIUe studying Computer Science and Creative Writing with hopes of going to the game development industry.
Recently, Ive been learning Godot and Gdscript along with my course curriculum teaching me basic web development, and basic computer structure.
Ive got plenty of experience with games, having participated in the 2024 and 2025 CougarJams, a series of club-hosted game jams. I won the 2025 CougarJam with the game Which Witch.
