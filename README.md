# Welcome!
Hello! Im BeeseChurger (He/Him), also known as D3vi1i5hV0id and Brandon. Im a student at SIUe studying Computer Science and Creative Writing with hopes of going to the game development industry. I have over 3 years of experience in Unity. Recently, Ive been learning Godot and Gdscript along with my course curriculum teaching me basic web development, and basic computer structure.
Ive got plenty of experience with games, having participated in the 2024 and 2025 CougarJams, a series of club-hosted game jams. I won the 2025 CougarJam with the game [Which Witch?](https://github.com/jackachulian/CougarJams2024) which my team and I are still working on after the game jam.

My most recent released game is [Which Witch?](https://github.com/jackachulian/CougarJams2024)!

## Which Witch?
Which Witch? is a Dating Sim\Rhythm game where each song is a conversation. Players have to multitask between answering the opponent's questions while also hit notes to the beat. This game was made for the CougarJam 2024, an event hosted by SIUe's Game Development Group where participants must form groups (or compete solo) and using a theme, make a game in under 36 hours. For this game, we used Godot, a new engine for me at the time, so I only had a minor role in the programming. I took on more of a project lead/lead designer. I wrote most of the dialogue in the game, including each question and answer prompts.

From this project, I would say I learned a lot about Godot and JSON files since most of the dialogue was written there. I also learned about rhythm games and syncing code to audio like to get notes to spawn for each beat of the song.
